Auto Highlight Symbol
=====================

**About Xcode 8**

Xcode 8 does't support plugins anymore, but there is a [workaround](https://github.com/chiahsien/AutoHighlightSymbol/issues/6), use at your own risk.

---

Xcode can highlight instances of selected symbol, but what it does is to add dash lines under the instances, which is hard to be noticed.

AutoHighlightSymbol is a plugin for Xcode, it adds background highlight color to those instances. It's super useful while you're tracing codes, especially when you want to figure out where a specific variable is used in a certain method.

You're welcome to improve it and send me pull requests.

Installation
------------
- Use [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/) to install and manage plugins, or

- Download the sources, build the project and restart Xcode.
 
- If you encounter any issues you can uninstall it by removing the ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/AutoHighlightSymbol.xcplugin folder.

Usage
-----
- You need to enable *Highlight instances of selected symbol* option first from *Xcode preferences -> Text Editing*.

- If it doesn't appear in your Xcode menu, read this [wiki document](https://github.com/chiahsien/AutoHighlightSymbol/wiki/Which-version-of-Xcode-does-it-support%3F) for more information.

- After installation, you need to enable it from Xcode **[Editor] -> [Auto Highlight Symbol]** menu.
